## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have made the following changes:

* Updated DESCRIPTION: Used only undirected quotation marks in the description text. e.g. `R` --> 'R'
* Replaced any occurrences of T with TRUE and F with FALSE
* Unwrapped examples of \donttest{}. Reduced examples to ensure that they are executed quickly.

## Test environments
* local windows 10, R 4.0.3
* local windows 10, R under development (unstable) (2021-02-17 r80023)
* local ubuntu 20.04, R 4.0.2
* win-builder  R version 4.0.4
* win-builder R Under development (unstable) (2021-02-20 r80030)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs
